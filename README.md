# Fantastic Beasts Shelter

This was my solo Ruby project for my CodeClan course. I chose to do the animal shelter brief, which involved creating an app for an animal shelter owner so that they could keep track of the animals in the shelter, the individuals who would like to adopt animals, and the adoptions that have been adopted.

I decided to base my animal shelter on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. I created an app that would allow the owner to check which beasts they have in the shelter, whether bests were available to be adopted or not, he can filter the beasts in his collection by type, and add a new beast to the collection. It is also possible to see individuals who would like to adopt a beast, he can add a new potential owner, and he can create a new adoption and see adoptions that have already taken place. There are also options to edit any of the information that is provided on the pages.
